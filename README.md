# Algorithms and Data Structures
Brushing up on some common algorithms and data structures


## Data Structures
### Hash Map

    * Basic Hash Map
    * Linear Probing Hash Map

### Stack

    * Basic Stack implementation using Deque
    * A few extenstions for stack -> Reversing a string, Checking balanced paranthesis

### Counter

    * Basic Counter implementation that mimics collections.Counter
